[org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) is a plain-text personal knowledge management system for [emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs). [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) is org exporter backend that exports `org-mode` files to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) compatible Markdown.

Because the Markdown generated by ox-hugo is not pure Markdown but Hugo specific, we need to transform it to fit into Quartz. This is done by `Plugin.OxHugoFlavouredMarkdown`. Even though this [[making plugins|plugin]] was written with `ox-hugo` in mind, it should work for any Hugo specific Markdown.

```typescript title="quartz.config.ts"
plugins: {
  transformers: [
    Plugin.FrontMatter({ delims: "+++", language: "toml" }), // if toml frontmatter
    // ...
    Plugin.OxHugoFlavouredMarkdown(),
    Plugin.GitHubFlavoredMarkdown(),
    // ...
  ],
},
```

## Usage

Quartz by default doesn't understand `org-roam` files as they aren't Markdown. You're responsible for using an external tool like `ox-hugo` to export the `org-roam` files as Markdown content to Quartz and managing the static assets so that they're available in the final output.

## Configuration

- Link resolution
  - `wikilinks`: Whether to replace `{{ relref }}` with Quartz [[wikilinks]]
  - `removePredefinedAnchor`: Whether to remove [pre-defined anchor set by ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/anchors/).
- Image handling
  - `replaceFigureWithMdImg`: Whether to replace `<figure/>` with `![]()`
- Formatting
  - `removeHugoShortcode`: Whether to remove hugo shortcode syntax (`{{}}`)
  - `replaceOrgLatex`: Whether to replace org-mode formatting for latex fragments with what `Plugin.Latex` supports.

> [!warning]
>
> While you can use `Plugin.OxHugoFlavoredMarkdown` and `Plugin.ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown` together, it's not recommended because it might mutate the file in unexpected ways. Use with caution.
